# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

We use dynamic programming to solve the problem of finding disparity maps. The disparity map is a 2D array of the same size as the left image, where each element in the array represents the disparity of the corresponding pixel in the left image. The disparity of a pixel is the difference in the x-axis between the pixel and its corresponding pixel in the right image.
