# Block Matching

Block matching is a technique used in stereo vision to find the disparity between two images. The disparity is the difference in the horizontal position of a point in the two images. The disparity is used to construct a 3D model of the world.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for block matching is as follows:

## Parameters

The parameters for block matching are as follows:

1. window size

1. search range (`numDisparities`)

### Window Size

The window size is the size of the window used to compare the blocks. The window size is a square, so the window size is the length of one side of the square.

### Search Range

The search range is the number of disparities to search for. The search range is the number of pixels to the left and right of the current pixel to search for the best match.
