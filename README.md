# Stereo Vision

Stereo is constructing a 3D model of the world from two images taken from different viewpoints. This is done by finding corresponding points in the two images, and then using the epipolar geometry to triangulate the points. The resulting 3D model can be used for a variety of applications, such as 3D reconstruction, object recognition, and augmented reality.
